[u"I think I first heard about `` blogs '' about a year ago . I 'm sure at the time I swore I 'd never have one , now here I am . A suggestion from a good friend and I steped right up ... me and myself might have something to say about what `` I '' have done . A year ago things were simpler . I had no idea what I was in store for . Getting laid-off , going back to school , losing people I never thought I 'd see walk away . On the other hand I guess I did n't think I 'd get to see my parents again for the first time in 5 years . I probably have more mixed feelings about that than anything ... but I 'll save that for another post ... So here I am . Somehow the world feels smaller every year . I feel like the boundaries society places on our minds through work and school has shrunk my mind and locked it up ... I did n't feel this way a year ago ... as if every year this world pushes us all one step closer to accepting the bull shit as normal ... I 'm not normal ... now I 'm a blogger ", u"I do n't like when people ask `` How are you ? '' Because instead of saying : `` I googled the prices of veterinary xanax this morning because I 'm seeking any kind of relief from this inescapable malaise and self-worthlessness I 've been battling for the last 14 years . '' I have remind myself that they 're not actually asking how I am , and that it 's just a greeting and that I have to say `` Ahh , y'know , just living . '' so they do n't worry . I wish someone would ask how I am and actually care about the answer . "]
