[u"Please try watching The Joy of Painting with Bob Ross It may not have the same effect on you as it does me , hence why I say `` please try '' . That show calms me , makes me feel better , and helps me sleep . Bob Ross has a soothing voice and I love his mindset . You can watch the entirety of the show on the official Bob Ross YouTube channel . ", u"Music to uplift ? Okay , Reddit , I 'm having a really rough 6 months . I keep thinking the fog will lift any day now but it just sits there blurring the line between myself and the things I once enjoyed . Maybe some music would help . Is there anything out there that you 've listened to to help you feel happier ? I guess the moody shit I 've been listening to nonstop probably is n't doing me any favors . : ) "]
